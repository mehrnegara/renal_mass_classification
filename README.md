# Machine Learning Based Classification of Aggressive and Malignant Renal Tumors from Multimodal Data

This repository contains the implementation used in the paper  
**"Machine Learning Based Classification of Aggressive and Malignant Renal Tumors from Multimodal Data"**,  
available on [MedRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/).

The project integrates radiological and clinical data to classify renal tumors into three categories: **Benign**, **Indolent Malignant**, and **Aggressive Malignant** using contrastive learning representations.  
It supports both **image-based** and **embedding-based (MLP)** pipelines.
